<p>This is a paragraph: A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” <small>(Lunsford and Connors 116)</small>. Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.  </p>
